This project is an example of how to integrate UNITY testing into a C project.

│   ├── interest.c
│   ├── interest.h
│   ├── money.c
│   └── money.h

        ├── unity.c
        ├── unity.h
        ├── unity.h.gch
        └── unity_internals.h

DEPENDENCIES:
Test results are performed by "results.py". This file is run after "make test" due to test file dependency on source code.

To add a new test file, copy an example such as TestInterest.c and rename it to match your source file. For example

UNITY framework is located in 'unity/src' and is built during "make test"

USAGE:
The Makefile will compile test files and print results.

#> make
-- Builds the main binary

#> make test
-- Builds test files and prints output

#> make clean
-- Removes all build files and test executables
